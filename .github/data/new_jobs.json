A relentless curiosity and passion for exploring new technologies and techniques in the AI/ML space. Experience using LLM-powered IDEs or coding assistants. Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to navigate ambiguity. Must be able to work from the Bandwidth headquarters in Raleigh, NC. Bonus Points: Significant experience in startups or similar fast-moving, resource-constrained organizations is highly desirable. Solid understanding and practical experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and associated concepts, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and various prompting techniques (e.g., Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought). Experience implementing services or applications built on top of foundational LLMs (via APIs or open-source models). Experience with LLM training, fine-tuning (e.g., LoRa), and/or developing custom evaluation benchmarks. Familiarity with advanced AI architectures and concepts such as agentic systems (e.g., ReAct), multi-modal models, Mixture of Experts (MoE), or LLM tooling/external capabilities. Experience with MLOps practices and cloud-based ML platforms (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google AI Platform). Familiarity with AI Developer and Agentic Frameworks (e.g., OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen) Experience contributing to AI/ML research, publications, or open-source projects.

    "job_description": "Here at Hometap, we’re collaborative, passionate, and always ready to roll up our sleeves to create solutions that help people get more out of homeownership — and out of life. Our first product, a home equity investment, gives homeowners the opportunity to quickly access the equity they’ve built in their home to pay for what’s most important to them, from handling debt to finally making much-needed renovations, without taking on debt. We work hard, and have some fun along the way, too. You don’t have to take our word for it: The Boston Globe and Forbes have recognized us as a great place to work, and we’ve been honored for our commitment to innovation in the fintech space by Inc., HousingWire, and more! In case you need any more convincing, we also provide competitive compensation, healthcare coverage, unlimited PTO, a generous share package, and a strong culture with plenty of opportunities for team-building and camaraderie. Interested in joining us on our mission to make homeownership less stressful and more accessible? We’d love to talk.As Hometap’s Full Stack Engineering Co-op, you’ll be embedded in a focused pod of four engineers and a QA engineer, working closely with product managers and engineering leadership to build software that helps homeowners access the equity in their homes. Your time will be split between hands-on development, contributing to technical discussions, learning from senior teammates, and taking ownership of features that directly impact our users. This role is about more than just writing code — it's about developing your technical expertise while contributing to impactful solutions that drive our mission forward. Hometap is Boston based, but our team works remotely on a day-to-day basis. We do have an office location in Back Bay where you're welcome and encouraged to work in person, if that is preferred. Co-ops must be in the United States for the duration of their work with Hometap. What you’ll do: Design, build, and test software — primarily using Python and JavaScript/TypeScript — with a focus on clean, maintainable architecture Collaborate closely with engineers, product managers, QA, and stakeholders to shape requirements and deliver impactful features using Agile practices. Integrate with a wide range of systems, including Digifi.io, Salesforce, AVM providers, credit bureaus, Segment, and Camunda Maintain a high bar for code quality through peer reviews, testing, and clear documentation Provide feedback to teammates and Technical Product Organization leaders on processes and projects What you’ll bring: Previous internship or co-op experience in a software engineering role Experience using modern programming languages and frameworks – our stack includes Python (Django) and JavaScript/TypeScript (React), but we value adaptability and engineering fundamentals over specific tech Strong understanding of relational database design and querying fundamentals Experience with cloud services, preferably AWS Proficiency with Git or other revision control systems Familiarity with API design, development, and documentation Bonus Points: Experience with cloud services, preferably AWS Experience working in fintech or regulated industries with high standards for security and compliance Exposure to products where software supports the delivery of a financial service, rather than being the end product itself Familiarity with the fintech ecosystem, including concepts like underwriting, credit, or financial data integrations The compensation for this role is $30-$32/hr Here's what our previous co-ops have to say:\"Hometap opened a lot of doors for me in the world of engineering within financial technologies. From day one, I felt like a valued team member; I was working on projects with significant impact on the business and gaining real-world experience. The mentorship and support created a welcoming environment where questions were encouraged and learning was constant.\" \"My experience at Hometap has been incredibly rewarding. When I started as a co-op, I felt meaningful ownership of our codebase, collaborating with my team on important objectives. My company and team have provided me with a clear trajectory for growth, giving me the resources needed to excel. I've been able to actively shape our team agreements, influence our operational practices, and have a genuine voice in how we work together.\"Hometap is on a mission to make homeownership less stressful and more accessible. Our home equity investment product provides homeowners with a fast, simple, and straightforward way to access the equity in their home without taking out a loan or having to sell. By investing alongside homeowners, Hometap offers debt-free cash in exchange for a share of their home’s future value — all without any monthly payments over the life of the investment. Through a combination of financial innovation and best-in-class customer service, Hometap enables people to get more from homeownership so they can get more from life. Hometap believes that our differences are what bring us together, and one of our biggest priorities is creating a diverse workplace that welcomes and values each team member’s unique perspective, background, and ideas.
