To Apply: Submit a one-page resume that outlines your work experience, accomplishments, and your graduation month and year. Submit a cover letter that highlights your passion for NBCUniversal, the locations (listed below) you are open to for internships, and your top areas of interest (opportunities listed below). Upload a transcript (unofficial transcripts are fine) that confirms your status as an actively enrolled student in a degree-granting program. Media Tech Internship Program Here at NBCU, we strive to be on the forefront of leading-edge technology and are seeking a savvy troop of technologists we call Media Tech Interns. Our Media Tech internship program exposes students to technical opportunities across NBCUniversal’s Operations & Technology organizations and serves as the primary pathway for consideration into our Media Tech Associate Program – a challenging two-year rotational program for individuals with a passion for technology. Many of our past interns have gone on to join the Associate Program, which helps participants jump-start their careers by promoting technical breadth through mentorship, networking opportunities, and technical training. More information on this pipeline program can be found at nbcunicareers.com/mediatech/associate-program. As an NBCUniversal Media Tech Intern, you will gain hands-on experience, allowing you to apply your classroom knowledge to practical situations. We offer a 2-day in-person orientation in our NY office where we bring all interns together to meet each other and various business leaders. Students will experience firsthand how one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the world operates and delivers strategic, innovative solutions. Areas of placement may include, but are not limited to: Site Reliability - Automation: Our goal is to help teams reduce risk, cost, and manual effort and improve accuracy across NBCU by standardizing and implementing best practices.

Automation Engineering brings deep expertise in systems architecture, process optimization, and automation to every engagement to help teams turn opportunities into lasting improvements. We are one of the few teams that provide tailored solutions for all groups in the company. Our normal workload primarily consists of the development of Ansible roles / tasks related to automate tasks for Corporate and Media systems and / or applications. Depending on what projects are active at the time, there would also likely be development activities related to one of our home-grown portals (using React or similar Javascript framework). We are also picking up some fairly complex AI related projects as well that we expect the intern to be working on. Production Application Engineering: The Production Application Engineering team provides services to multiple businesses within the larger NBCU Enterprise, including the architecture and deployment of 2 internal platforms to support live news production - Virtual Production Control Room (VPCR) and NBCU Forge. VPCR leverages public cloud for elastic expansion of resources to deliver live news in markets across the US, reducing the time needed to produce new content for different platforms. Forge is meant to ease the onboarding of vendor solutions into the NBCU ecosystem by building a framework that can be leveraged for different projects without rebuilding the underlying platform. Global Network Engineering, WiFi: The Wi-Fi team is part of the NBC Global Network Engineering team which operates all internet connectivity for NBCU internal businesses. We are tasked to install, enhance, troubleshoot, and excel the Wi-Fi network to provide users with a seamless and fast user experience.

Production Technology Architecture: The Production Technology Architecture team is a subset of the NBCU Production Engineering team. This group is primarily tasked with designing, implementing and configuring major broadcast production systems such as video routers, IP audio systems, and studios technology. An intern working with this team will be tasked with a large variety of tasks in these efforts, especially focused on the buildout of new control rooms and video control systems for 30 Rock production operations. PDEX, Sales & Finance Engineering: The Sales and Finance Engineering team’s mission is to build technology solutions that make our Content Sales and Finance operations faster, smarter, and more efficient. An Intern on our team will gain hands-on experience with projects that enable how NBCU delivers and automates the exchange of digital media assets with streaming partners, starting with Amazon Prime Video. This position provides an up-close view of how NBCU systems distribute creative content to Partners through automation, data, and collaboration across business and technology teams.

    "job_description": "Here at Hometap, we’re collaborative, passionate, and always ready to roll up our sleeves to create solutions that help people get more out of homeownership — and out of life. Our first product, a home equity investment, gives homeowners the opportunity to quickly access the equity they’ve built in their home to pay for what’s most important to them, from handling debt to finally making much-needed renovations, without taking on debt. We work hard, and have some fun along the way, too. You don’t have to take our word for it: The Boston Globe and Forbes have recognized us as a great place to work, and we’ve been honored for our commitment to innovation in the fintech space by Inc., HousingWire, and more! In case you need any more convincing, we also provide competitive compensation, healthcare coverage, unlimited PTO, a generous share package, and a strong culture with plenty of opportunities for team-building and camaraderie. Interested in joining us on our mission to make homeownership less stressful and more accessible? We’d love to talk.As Hometap’s Full Stack Engineering Co-op, you’ll be embedded in a focused pod of four engineers and a QA engineer, working closely with product managers and engineering leadership to build software that helps homeowners access the equity in their homes. Your time will be split between hands-on development, contributing to technical discussions, learning from senior teammates, and taking ownership of features that directly impact our users. This role is about more than just writing code — it's about developing your technical expertise while contributing to impactful solutions that drive our mission forward. Hometap is Boston based, but our team works remotely on a day-to-day basis. We do have an office location in Back Bay where you're welcome and encouraged to work in person, if that is preferred. Co-ops must be in the United States for the duration of their work with Hometap. What you’ll do: Design, build, and test software — primarily using Python and JavaScript/TypeScript — with a focus on clean, maintainable architecture Collaborate closely with engineers, product managers, QA, and stakeholders to shape requirements and deliver impactful features using Agile practices. Integrate with a wide range of systems, including Digifi.io, Salesforce, AVM providers, credit bureaus, Segment, and Camunda Maintain a high bar for code quality through peer reviews, testing, and clear documentation Provide feedback to teammates and Technical Product Organization leaders on processes and projects What you’ll bring: Previous internship or co-op experience in a software engineering role Experience using modern programming languages and frameworks – our stack includes Python (Django) and JavaScript/TypeScript (React), but we value adaptability and engineering fundamentals over specific tech Strong understanding of relational database design and querying fundamentals Experience with cloud services, preferably AWS Proficiency with Git or other revision control systems Familiarity with API design, development, and documentation Bonus Points: Experience with cloud services, preferably AWS Experience working in fintech or regulated industries with high standards for security and compliance Exposure to products where software supports the delivery of a financial service, rather than being the end product itself Familiarity with the fintech ecosystem, including concepts like underwriting, credit, or financial data integrations The compensation for this role is $30-$32/hr Here's what our previous co-ops have to say:\"Hometap opened a lot of doors for me in the world of engineering within financial technologies. From day one, I felt like a valued team member; I was working on projects with significant impact on the business and gaining real-world experience. The mentorship and support created a welcoming environment where questions were encouraged and learning was constant.\" \"My experience at Hometap has been incredibly rewarding. When I started as a co-op, I felt meaningful ownership of our codebase, collaborating with my team on important objectives. My company and team have provided me with a clear trajectory for growth, giving me the resources needed to excel. I've been able to actively shape our team agreements, influence our operational practices, and have a genuine voice in how we work together.\"Hometap is on a mission to make homeownership less stressful and more accessible. Our home equity investment product provides homeowners with a fast, simple, and straightforward way to access the equity in their home without taking out a loan or having to sell. By investing alongside homeowners, Hometap offers debt-free cash in exchange for a share of their home’s future value — all without any monthly payments over the life of the investment. Through a combination of financial innovation and best-in-class customer service, Hometap enables people to get more from homeownership so they can get more from life. Hometap believes that our differences are what bring us together, and one of our biggest priorities is creating a diverse workplace that welcomes and values each team member’s unique perspective, background, and ideas.

    "job_description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: Our Applied Machine Learning Engineering internship is a 12-week hybrid summer experience focused on making a significant impact on our customers by being embedded directly into our data teams. Each intern is paired with a dedicated mentor and a team manager, providing guidance and support as they make immediate contributions to the team’s roadmap, directly advancing Gusto’s mission. At Gusto, we are committed to leveraging data to build the products of the future. As an Applied Machine Learning Engineering Intern, you'll be at the forefront of this effort, focusing on the end-to-end development of production-level machine learning systems. You'll gain hands-on experience in building, deploying, and maintaining models that directly impact our customers and our business. Your work will directly support teams across the company, helping to build new features, optimize our operations, and improve products for hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Please note: We’ll be offering only one cohort start and end date (May 18 - August 7, 2026). Deadline to Apply: Tuesday, November 25, 2025 About the Team: Our Applied Machine Learning Engineers solve some of the hardest problems our small business customers present to us. How can we introduce features in a way that is inspirational and engaging? And how to make those recommendations timely based on the problems or opportunities in front of them? By joining our team, you’ll not only learn the fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning delivery but also how to greatly enhance your impact by curating an entire customer journey. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day (and we’ll support you so you’re great at it): Build and deploy scalable machine learning models and pipelines in a production environment. Write production-quality code to integrate models into our core platform and products. Work with diverse teams across product, engineering, and data to understand business problems and translate them into machine learning solutions. Develop and maintain monitoring systems to ensure the performance and reliability of deployed models. Partner with Data Scientists to evaluate and test models to prepare them for production. Here’s what we're looking for: Currently pursuing a Master's ( with an expected graduation date between December 2026 and June 2027) or PhD (graduating between December 2026 and June 2028) in Computer Science or a related technical field. Strong programming skills in Python and experience with machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch). Experience leveraging AI effectively as a development partner to offload manual tasks, explore new approaches, or evaluate the end-to-end performance. Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) and familiarity with big data technologies (e.g., Spark, Hive). Understanding of the full ML lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Familiarity with LLM applications is desired but not required. We continue to explore how our work can feed into agentic solutions for our customers. Excellent communication and collaboration skills with the ability to work in a cross-functional environment. A passion for building robust, scalable systems and solving real-world problems. U.S. work authorization is required. This role is not available for sponsorship. This is a hybrid role and will require you to be in the office at least twice a week in our San Francisco. Relocation assistance will be provided during your internship. Pay and benefits Our cash compensation range for this role for graduate students is $78.37/hr to $85.58/hr in San Francisco. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale. Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required. This includes non-office days for hybrid employees. Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Gusto. Gusto is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.
