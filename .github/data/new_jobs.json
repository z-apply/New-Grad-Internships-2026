    "job_description": "Lightmatter is leading the revolution in AI data center infrastructure, enabling the next giant leaps in human progress. The company invented the world’s first 3D-stacked photonics engine, Passage™, capable of connecting thousands to millions of processors at the speed of light in extreme-scale data centers for the most advanced AI and HPC workloads. Lightmatter raised $400 million in its Series D round, reaching a valuation of $4.4 billion. We will continue to accelerate the development of data center photonics and grow every department at Lightmatter! If you're passionate about tackling complex challenges, making an impact, and being an expert in your craft, join our team of brilliant scientists, engineers, and accomplished industry leaders. Lightmatter is (re)inventing the future of computing with light!About this Role We are hiring an Intern for our Platform team at Lightmatter! We are a photonic computer company redefining what computers and human beings are capable of by building the engines that will power discoveries and drive progress in a sustainable way. With modern human progress relying heavily on computers, the world has hit a dead end with traditional transistors, and the prospect of constantly building data centers is an environmental nightmare. Lightmatter has created a solution in photonic computing: using photons instead of electrons to take advantage of their higher bandwidth. We build chips for artificial intelligence computing. Our architecture leverages the unique properties of light to enable fast and efficient inference and training engines. Responsibilities API Design & Development: Build and maintain APIs to support the flow of live data and historical data (from a database) between backend services and the frontend Next.js application, focusing on dynamic data fetching.
