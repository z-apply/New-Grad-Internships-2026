Your work will directly impact users on day 1. We have a highly responsive user base that depends on our product day in and day out. What you'll do as a Fall Engineering Intern: Work on real product features end-to-end with mentorship: research, design, implement, test, and ship. Talk directly to customers and help translate requirements into polished experiences. Build backend systems alongside our team (we use Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, GCP). Create responsive, delightful UIs (we use React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui). Write clean, maintainable, and testable code with guidance from senior engineers. Participate in architectural discussions and learn our engineering processes. Work with a high sense of urgency – we ship fast and learn fast.

Why join us for your Fall internship: Unlike most internships, you'll work on production code solving real problems for real customers. You'll get autonomy and ownership — no coffee runs or busy work. Your code will be in front of users within days, not months. You'll receive mentorship from a strong engineering team while having real responsibility. You'll experience the full startup journey and shape not just the product but also the company. Strong performers will receive return offers for full-time positions.",
