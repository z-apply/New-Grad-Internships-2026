Experience leveraging AI effectively as a development partner to offload manual tasks, explore new approaches, or evaluate the end-to-end performance. Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) and familiarity with big data technologies (e.g., Spark, Hive). Understanding of the full ML lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Familiarity with LLM applications is desired but not required. We continue to explore how our work can feed into agentic solutions for our customers.
