    "description": "2026 Summer Intern - Biological Research - AI DevelopmentDepartment SummaryAt Roche/Genentech, we are on an exciting journey to bring together and further strengthen our computational talent and capabilities in a central organization - Computational Sciences Center of Excellence (CS CoE). Our mission is to realize the potential of data, technology and computational approaches that will revolutionize how targets and therapeutics are discovered and developed, ultimately enabling novel treatments for patients across the world. Within CS CoE, AI Biology & Translation is a department that formulate, develop,and apply cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and statistical methods to decode complex biology; transform approaches to target discovery and assessment, and biomarker discovery and clinical analysis. Within AIBT, Biology Research AI Development (BRAID) is a group of computational scientists dedicated to advancing biological and clinical sciences through artificial intelligence. Our work focuses on developing foundation models, including general-purpose AI systems trained on large-scale biological datasets, and fine-tuning them for specialized scientific applications. At BRAID, we not only build cutting-edge AI tools, but we also actively apply them to drive new scientific discoveries and accelerate innovation across the research pipeline.This internship position is located in South San Francisco, on-site. The OpportunityAs key Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED) initiatives continue to grow in scale and complexity, effective coordination between experimental and computational teams is critical. The intern will support cross-functional project management at the intersection of data generation (wet lab) and computational data analysis including AI/ML approaches (dry lab), and assist in the integration of project tracking (deliverables, timelines, status etc).The intern will help develop and/or improve tools and processes that improve visibility, alignment, and communication across the various teams who are generating, processing, analyzing, and interpreting biological data, and building foundation models. Overall, this role will contribute to improving the efficiency and impact of large gRED initiatives. This internship will directly support improved coordination between experimental and computational teams, leading to clearer visibility of project timelines and dependencies, streamlined project execution, and reduced latency between data generation and analysis. The tools and processes developed will serve as a foundation for ongoing large, complex cross-pillar integration efforts in current and future gRED initiatives.The intern will gain:Firsthand exposure to how large-scale interdisciplinary biological and computational programs are managed in an R&D environment.Experience collaborating with experimental and computational scientists, and ML engineers.Skills in cross-functional communication, stakeholder management, and data-driven project planning.Understanding of large-scale data pipelines and how experimental and computational efforts integrate to advance discovery.Exposure to how AI/ML approaches are being applied in drug discovery.The intern will have weekly check-ins with the mentor, attend FDFM team meetings, and present progress updates at midpoint and at the end of the internship.Program HighlightsIntensive 12-weeks, full-time (40 hours per week) paid internship.Program start dates are in May/June (Summer). A stipend, based on location, will be provided to help alleviate costs associated with the internship. Ownership of challenging and impactful business-critical projects.Work with some of the most talented people in the biotechnology industry.Who You AreRequired Education:Must have attained a Bachelor's degree (recent graduates not currently enrolled in a grad program). Required Majors: Biological Sciences, Data Science, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology or Business. Required Skills: Strong organizational and analytical skills.Familiarity with data visualization and project management tools.PMP certified.Interest in the intersection of science and data, and in enabling large-scale, collaborative research.Preferred Knowledge, Skills, and QualificationsExcellent communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills.Complements our culture and the standards that guide our daily behavior & decisions: Integrity, Courage, and Passion.Relocation benefits are not available for this job posting. The expected salary range for this position based on the primary location of California is $45.00 per hour. Actual pay will be determined based on experience, qualifications, geographic location, and other job-related factors permitted by law.
