    "description": "At REGENT, we’re on a mission to revolutionize regional transportation between coastal cities. We're not just building vehicles, we're creating a new category of transportation: the seaglider. These groundbreaking wing-in-ground-effect craft travel just above the water’s surface, combining the speed of an airplane with the low operating costs of a boat. Capable of 180 miles at 180 mph on today's battery tech (and up to 400 miles with next-gen batteries), seagliders will unlock fast, affordable, and sustainable coastal transit for passengers and cargo - connecting cities, islands, and communities like never before. Backed by leading investors and powered by a team of passionate, forward-thinking engineers, builders, and operators, we’re now scaling from a breakthrough prototype to full production - and building the team to make it happen. Role Overview As an Embedded Software Engineering Intern at REGENT, you’ll play a critical role in helping build and test the systems that power our seagliders. You'll contribute to low-level software that interfaces with real vehicle hardware, supports flight testing, and ensures reliable system behavior on the water and in the air. In this role, you’ll work closely with senior embedded engineers to support the development of core control applications, sensor interfaces, and in-house testing tools. You’ll gain hands-on experience across embedded software, autonomy, and hardware-in-the-loop simulation — learning what it takes to deliver real, safety-critical systems from bench testing to sea trials. This internship is ideal for individuals who are curious, hands-on, and eager to see their code running on real vehicles in a fast-paced startup environment. If you’re energized by working at the intersection of cutting-edge innovation, real-world impact, and hands-on engineering, you’ll be in the right place - and we’d be thrilled to have you on the team! What You'll Do Support development and testing of embedded software in C/C++ for sensing, control, and system monitoring Help implement and verify drivers for vehicle hardware, sensors, and actuators Contribute to hardware-in-the-loop and simulation tools used in system testing and validation Assist in building and debugging embedded systems, from lab bench bring-up through on-vehicle testing Collaborate with autonomy, controls, and electrical engineering teams to support system integration What You'll Bring Pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or a related field Experience programming in C/C++ and interest in real-time or embedded environments Familiarity with microcontrollers (e.g., STM32, PIC32, Arduino) and software development tools Exposure to scripting languages such as Python or MATLAB Bonus Experience Coursework or experience with simulation tools (Simulink, LabVIEW, HIL environments) Experience with robotics, drones, or autonomous systems Prior project or lab experience in debugging hardware or writing firmware Who We're Looking For Collaborative Team Player: You believe that great things happen when teams work together. You communicate effectively and collaborate with engineers, stakeholders, and other cross-functional teams to align on goals and move projects forward. You bring people together, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and moving towards a shared vision. Creative Problem Solver : You thrive on tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions. Whether you're resolving installation challenges, debugging elusive electrical issues, or adapting on the fly during integration and test, you bring a practical, inventive mindset to every problem. You don't just patch issues - you improve processes, anticipate downstream impacts, and help turn one-off fixes into scalable solutions that raise the bar for future builds. Adaptable &amp; Agile: In a fast-paced, ever-evolving startup environment, you quickly adapt to changing priorities and requirements. You approach challenges with a calm, resilient mindset, and know how to pivot and adjust your approach as needed, ensuring that progress continues without missing a beat. Innovative Mindset : You’re driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. You’re passionate about driving continuous improvement, embracing new technologies and methodologies to enhance efficiency, quality, and team performance. What We Offer Competitive compensation Housing Stipend available for those temporarily moving to join our team Daily, free catered lunches Learning &amp; professional development opportunities Meaningful projects that make an impact Mentorship &amp; guidance from experienced team members If you’re ready to take on an exciting challenge, grow with us, and make a lasting impact, we want to hear from you. Even if you don’t meet every requirement, but you see yourself contributing to our mission, we encourage you to apply! We value diverse skillsets and experiences and believe in the potential of passionate individuals to make a big impact. Equal Opportunity Employer REGENT is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
