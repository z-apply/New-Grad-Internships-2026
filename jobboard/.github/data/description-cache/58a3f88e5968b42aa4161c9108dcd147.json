    "description": "Riot Research Scientists combine their wide technical expertise across data processing, automation, machine learning (\"ML\"), artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), and experimental design to inform decisions and develop robust research prototypes and inform data powered products. The Technology Research team performs applied research to accelerate the pace of building amazing player experiences at Riot Games. As a Research Scientist Intern on Tech Research, you’ll contribute to a research team whose focus is to leverage generative AI to augment, evolve, and even revolutionize game development pipelines and/or player experiences. To this end, you and your team will track the latest research in relevant areas, work closely with teams to prioritize the most promising research, build prototypes to highlight the value of new capabilities, and in certain cases partner with game teams to create robust and efficient production versions of your prototypes. Responsibilities: Partner with game teams and creators to shape the future of gameplay through next-generation technologies Partner with artists, designers, and engineers to prototype new applications of research Explore the application of large language models and state of the art content generation models to games in development and production Required Qualifications: Enrolled in an M.S. or Ph.D. program in statistics, engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, or a related quantitative field (math, physics, etc.) Graduating during the 2027 calendar year Available to work full-time hours for the 12 week internship duration Eligible to work in the country that you reside in during this remote program Experience in deep learning, including frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch Experience processing data and build machine learning models using Python Experience in machine learning techniques Experience in statistical modeling and optimization Desired Qualifications: Understanding of distributed systems and concurrent programming Familiarity with cloud computing basics on AWS (EC2, S3) Experience working with Linux operating systems Experience in C++ and game development (Unreal, Unity, Godot) Experience with version control systems. (We use Git) Experience in large language models, diffusion models, neural radiance fields, or Gaussian splats Experience in social network analysis, natural language processing, computer vision, or signal processing For this role, you'll find success through craft expertise, a collaborative spirit, and decision-making that prioritizes the delight of players. We will certainly be looking at your past studies and experience, but for this role, we also look for dedicated people with a personal relationship with games. If you embody player empathy and care about the experiences of players, this could be the role for you! Applications close Friday, January 9th, 2026 at 11:59pm PT Our Perks: Riot Internships are paid, and interns can also participate in our 401(k) plan. You can expect in-game perks, and the ability to participate in our Play Fund, so you can broaden and deepen your knowledge of our players and community through games. The University Programs team also invites you to intern focused events so you can connect with your fellow interns and Rioters to make the most out of your experience. At Riot Games, we put players first. That mission drives every decision in our quest to create games and experiences that make it better to be a player. Whether you’re working directly on a new player-facing experience or you’re supporting the company as a whole, everyone at Riot is part of our mission. And just like in our games, we’re better when we work together. Our goal is to create collaborative teams where you are empowered to bring your unique perspective everyday.
