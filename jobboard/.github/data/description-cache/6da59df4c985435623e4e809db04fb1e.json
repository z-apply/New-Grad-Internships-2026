    "description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: Our Product Management Internship (Master’s/MBA) is a 12-week hybrid summer experience focused on making a significant impact on our customers by being embedded directly into our product and cross-functional teams. Each intern is paired with a dedicated mentor and a team manager, providing guidance and support as they make immediate contributions to the team’s roadmap, directly advancing Gusto’s mission. You will be given opportunities to participate in various aspects of the product development lifecycle, including conducting customer and market research, influencing product strategy, writing clear product requirements, analyzing data, and collaborating with cross-functional partners to deliver delightful, high-impact features to market. Please note: We’ll be offering only one cohort (June 1, 2026 - August 21, 2026) in San Francisco, CA. About the Team: Our Product Managers work on both customer-facing and internal employee products, focusing on defining solutions and prioritizing investments across our platform to bring delightful experiences to our customers, aiding them in driving their business to be successful. You’ll close your laptop at the end of every day knowing your work is making a difference for hundreds of thousands of small businesses and their employees. If you’re ready to hone your Product Management craft while defining solutions with far-reaching effects on our modern economy, we’d love for you to join Gusto this summer! Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day (and we’ll support you so you’re great at it): Define and scope projects by gathering inputs from customers, internal stakeholders, market research, and data analysis. Draft clear and concise product requirements (user stories and specifications) that communicate the \"why\" and \"what\" to Engineering and Design teams. Analyze product performance metrics and user feedback to inform future iterations and prioritization decisions. Collaborate and pair with others on the team and cross-functionally, including working closely with Engineering and Design to ensure features are delivered efficiently and effectively. Understand the world of Gusto, our customers, and why we do what we do. Here’s what we're looking for: Graduate Students pursuing an MBA or MS degree in Business, Economics, Design, Computer Science, or a related analytical field with an expected graduation date between Winter 2026 and Spring 2027 and with at least 2+ years of previous professional experience. Passion for creating intuitive customer experiences, solving complex user problems, and accelerating product development with AI tools. Interest in methodologies such as Agile/Scrum, user research, data analytics, and experimentation (A/B testing). Appreciation for an iterative, data-driven culture and the ability to articulate product vision and strategy. Drive to articulate clear, impactful product requirements and strategies that balance customer needs, technical feasibility, and business outcomes. U.S. work authorization is required. This role is not available for sponsorship. This is a hybrid role and will require you to be in the office at least twice a week in our San Francisco office. Relocation assistance will be provided during your internship. Please note: We cannot guarantee full-time conversion opportunities at this time. Opportunities are dependent on business need. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $64.66/hr for graduate students in San Francisco. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role).

Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required. This includes non-office days for hybrid employees.
