    "description": "About Kalepa: Commercial insurance is a trillion-dollar industry run out of Microsoft Outlook. Kalepa is upending this. Our state-of-the-art AI Copilot platform empowers underwriters to make smarter, faster, and more accurate decisions. Our AI is designed to deliver real results - insurers literally see massive improvements to their top and bottom lines as soon as they implement Copilot. That’s why our clients call Copilot “truly an underwriter’s dream” and proclaim that Copilot helps them “almost double the amount of accounts they can look at in the day.\" Kalepa's team members bring experience from top technology companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, Mastercard, and Uber. Kalepa is backed by leading VCs like IA Ventures and Inspired Capital. Our Values (This is important): Many organizations have a dusty list of corporate values that no one ever follows. Kalepa is not one of those companies. Our values are designed to unlock the potential of our employees. Success at Kalepa is bred from five core principles: Hustle & Grit - We expect everyone at Kalepa to be excellent at what they do and relentless in pursuing their craft. There are no easy days. Kalepa’s exceptional speed and determination are our biggest differentiators: this is how we win. Customer Focus - We will ruthlessly prioritize the work that drives our clients’ growth, profitability, and efficiency. We are not building things just because they seem cool - we are here to solve our customers’ most strategic problems. Meritocracy - Too many exceptional people are stifled by corporate bureaucracies. At Kalepa, those people excel - and we reward tremendous results with rapid promotions and compensation growth. Transparency - We are honest with each other. We don’t believe in back-office politics and keeping employees in the dark. Transparency allows us to instantly cut to the heart of the matter and figure it out together. Experimentation - For many of the problems we face, no company has ever solved them before. We tackle these by quickly testing, measuring, and iterating to determine the path to success. In addition to our NY office, we have remote employees speaking 10+ languages across the globe. But we invest in bringing our people together both for regional meetups and global offsites (2021 - Playa Del Carmen | 2022 - Rome | 2023 - Buenos Aires | 2024 - Lisbon).
