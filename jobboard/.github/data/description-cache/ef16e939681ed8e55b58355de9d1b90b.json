    "description": "About Traversal Traversal is the AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for the enterprise—already trusted by some of the largest companies in the world to troubleshoot, remediate, and even prevent the most complex production incidents. Our mission is to free engineers from endless firefighting and enable them to focus on creative, high-impact work. Our roots remain deeply embedded in AI research, and we’re channeling that scientific rigor and creativity into building the premier AI agent lab for the enterprise. Hence, what we’re proudest of is assembling the most talented yet nicest group of individuals, including researchers from MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley, to world-class engineers from industry: Citadel Securities, Cockroach Labs, Datadog, DE Shaw, ServiceNow, Glean, Perplexity, Pinecone, and more, to take on one of the hardest problems for AI to solve. Without the entire team, none of this would be possible. The Role As a Software Engineer Intern at Traversal, you’ll help build the core product and AI systems that power our observability platform. Depending on your interests and the team’s needs, you might work on: Backend services and API Frontend product experiences AI agents and LLM-powered workflows Data and infrastructure that keep everything fast and reliable You’ll work closely with experienced engineers across AI, backend, infra, and product to ship real features that help engineers understand and debug complex systems. What you'll do Ship product features: Contribute to scoped features across the stack—from backend logic to frontend UI. Build and integrate APIs: Help design, implement, and maintain APIs and services that power user workflows and AI integrations. Work with AI & agents: Collaborate with AI engineers to plug LLMs and agent workflows into real product experiences. Handle real data: Work with logs, metrics, traces, or other system data to make insights understandable and actionable. Experiment & iterate: Prototype ideas, run experiments, and use data and feedback to decide what to improve or ship. Debug & improve reliability: Help test, debug, and improve the performance and reliability of the systems you work on. You Might Be Good If You’re graduating with a BS/MS in Computer Science or a related field (or have equivalent experience), or you’re currently a student looking for an internship. You have strong coding skills in Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust, or similar, and you’ve built real projects (internships, research, hackathons, side projects). You’re interested in one or more of: Full-stack development (backend + frontend) AI/LLMs and agents Infrastructure, distributed systems, or data-heavy applications You enjoy debugging, learning new systems, and working through ambiguous problems. You’re excited by startups: high ownership, fast iteration, and working closely with a small, senior team. Nice to Have Experience with React, TypeScript, Next.js, or other modern frontend frameworks. Exposure to backend frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) or databases like Postgres. Projects involving LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or agentic workflows. Familiarity with observability data (logs, metrics, traces) or incident response tools. Exposure to cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), Docker, or Kubernetes. Contributions to open source or personal projects you’re proud to show. Compensation We offer competitive compensation for this internship. The hourly rate for this in-person role in New York is $40–$60 per hour, depending on experience and interview performance. Interns receive a great tech setup, in-office snacks, and access to team events. Eligibility for additional benefits may vary based on internship length and employment classification. Why You Should Join Us We’ll make sure you’re set up for success with a strong tech setup, hands-on mentorship, and plenty of in-office snacks. You’ll work closely with a small, senior team, ship real features, and see how an AI startup operates from the inside. Traversal is fully in-office, 5 days a week, based in New York near Madison Square Park. We have a collaborative, hard-working culture and are energized by building the future of AI-powered software maintenance. Working here as an intern means contributing to meaningful parts of the product, moving fast, and learning constantly. It’s a great place to grow your skills, make a real impact, and explore what a career in infrastructure and AI could look like.",
