    "description": "On the Input and UX Explorations team within Meta Reality Labs (RL), our role is to explore cutting edge input and realize novel interactions for AI-enhanced wearable computing, including but not limited to Meta’s industry-leading smart glasses and neural band product lines. We are searching for a skilled and motivated research intern to join our team and help us unleash human potential by bridging the gap between user intent and system action. We are specifically looking for a scientifically-minded candidate with experience in HCI, AI, and interactive computing. Our ideal candidate can go from ideation to implementation and validation of prototypes with ease, and is looking for a research environment with access to cutting edge sensors, resources, and testing facilities. More broadly, the chosen candidate will work with a diverse and highly interdisciplinary team of user researchers, prototypers, scientists, designers, and engineers to realize the potential of novel inputs and interfaces for wearables. Our internships are twelve (12) to twenty four (24) weeks long and we have various start dates throughout the year.",
