We are seeking an intern that can bridge data science and engineering to enable scalable, high-performance analytics products and ad-hoc analyses that leverage data for actionable insights. The Data Science Intern will collaborate across multiple teams including data engineering, business intelligence, product, and analytics, to build robust data pipelines, deploy machine learning models, and develop solutions that power predictive analytics. You will have the opportunity (and the expectation!) to leverage enterprise-level AI tools to help you in these projects. If you are the kind of person who gets told a problem is “unsolvable” and your first reaction is “Ok, how would I solve it?”, this is the team for you.What You’ll DoAssist in building modular, reusable components for data transformation, feature extraction, and model deployment using modern cloud technologies (Google Cloud Platform).Contribute to the design and deployment of machine learning models and advanced analytics pipelines to deliver scalable solutions.Collaborate with internal stakeholders on the design of machine learning models and advanced analytics to deliver a range of ad-hoc solutions, with the ability to identify commonalities in requests and propose new products based on recurring themes.Your QualificationsCurrently pursuing a Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics with a concentration in Data Science, Data Engineering, or any related quantitative field with a strong emphasis on statistical programming and working with big data (e.g. Economics, Psychology, Computer Science, etc.).Strong analytical, organizational, communication, and problem-solving skills.Proficiency in DML (SQL) and cloud systems (Google Cloud preferred, but AWS, Azure, Spark, etc., are all great).
