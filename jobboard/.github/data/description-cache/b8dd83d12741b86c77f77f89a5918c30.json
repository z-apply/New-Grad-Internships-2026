    "description": "NVIDIA has been transforming computer graphics, PC gaming, and accelerated computing for more than 25 years. It’s a unique legacy of innovation that’s fueled by great technology—and amazing people. Today, we’re tapping into the unlimited potential of AI to define the next era of computing. An era in which our GPU acts as the brains of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can understand the world. Doing what’s never been done before takes vision, innovation, and the world’s best talent. As an NVIDIAN, you’ll be immersed in a diverse, supportive environment where everyone is inspired to do their best work. Come join the team and see how you can make a lasting impact on the world.We are looking for outstanding High Performance AI Intern to build groundbreaking high-performance, multi-agent AI systems for the CUDA ecosystem across NVIDIA's software/hardware stack. You will collaborate closely with internal NVIDIA software and hardware teams to push the latest developments into NVIDIA products.What you'll be doing:Design, build and optimize agentic AI systems and coding tools for the CUDA ecosystem.Co-design agentic system solutions with software, hardware and algorithm teams; influence and adopt new capabilities as they become available. Collaborate across the AI stack—from hardware through compilers/toolchains, kernels/libraries, frameworks, distributed training, and inference/serving—and with model/agent teams.Develop reproducible/scalable, high-fidelity evaluation/data engineering frameworks covering performance, quality and developer productivity.What we need to see:You are pursuing a Bachelors, Masters or PhD in CS/ECEKnowledge in agentic AI, LLMs, reinforcement learning, HPC, computer architecture, and/or programming languages/compilersExperience with AI systems development; exposure to building foundational models, agents or orchestration frameworks; hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks and modern inference stacks.C/C++ and Python programming skills; solid software engineering fundamentals.Experience with GPU programming and performance optimization (CUDA or equivalent).Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd:PhD is preferredStrong experience in building/evaluating large AI models and agentic AI (coding/research) systems.Demonstrated ability to optimize and deploy high-performance AI models, including on resource-constrained platforms; or GPU performance optimizations, evidenced by benchmark wins or published results.Publications or open-source leadership in deep learning, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, or AI systems; contributions to widely used repos or standards.With competitive salaries and a generous benefits package, we are widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most forward-thinking and hardworking people in the world working for us and, due to unprecedented growth, our exclusive engineering teams are rapidly growing. If you're a creative and autonomous researcher/engineer with a real passion for technology, we want to hear from you.Our internship hourly rates are a standard pay based on the position, your location, year in school, degree, and experience. The hourly rate for our interns is 20 USD - 71 USD. You will also be eligible for Intern benefits. ​Applications for this job will be accepted at least until November 28, 2025.
