    "description": "Figure is an AI robotics company developing autonomous general-purpose humanoid robots. The goal of the company is to ship humanoid robots with human level intelligence. Its robots are engineered to perform a variety of tasks in the home and commercial markets. Figure is headquartered in San Jose, CA. Figure AI's Reliability team is looking for a motivated and talented Reliability Test Engineering Intern to join our team for an extended internship of 8 to 12 months. In this role, you will be a key contributor to the development and testing of our humanoid hardware systems, ensuring our products are meeting the reliability targets. This is a unique, hands-on opportunity to apply your academic knowledge to real-world challenges in a fast-paced and dynamic environment. Responsibilities: Design and build custom scalable test stations to perform functional, performance, and reliability testing on key robotic sub-assemblies. Develop mechanical and electrical systems incorporating diverse hardware components including, DAQ, communication modules, actuators, and sensors. Facilitate the electromechanical integration of sensors, motors, and controllers, ensuring proper functionality and communication within the system. Generate detailed electrical schematic drawings and wiring diagram documentation. Collaborate with cross-functional engineering teams on hands-on testing, data analysis, and iterative design improvements. Contribute to the root cause analysis and resolution of complex hardware-software integration issues across mechanical, electrical, and control domains. Conduct test-station bring-up and qualification to ensure system robustness, and drive setup improvements to meet testing and data-capture requirements. Requirements: Portfolio or website showcasing relevant projects and your role Pursuing a degree in Mechanical, Robotics, Mechatronics, Electrical or a related engineering field, with at least two years completed by the start of the internship Demonstrated hands-on experience designing, building, and testing mechanical or electromechanical prototypes. Familiarity version control (Git) and programming (e.g., Python, C++, C, MATLAB) Strong hands-on hardware aptitude and a proven ability to take hardware projects from concept to reality. Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills with a keen attention to detail. Strong written and verbal communication skills for effective collaboration with cross-functional teams. A genuine passion for robotics and hardware development. Bonus Qualifications: Proficiency in CAD software for mechanical and electrical design. (CATIA V6 experience) Familiarity with rapid prototyping (3D printing, circuit design) Familiarity with manufacturing processes and first article inspection Familiarity with test station qualification process Experience with sensors, motors, or electromechanical systems Familiarity with Linux The US hourly range for this internship position is between $35 - $45/hr. The pay offered for this position may vary based on several individual factors, including job-related knowledge, skills, and experience.
